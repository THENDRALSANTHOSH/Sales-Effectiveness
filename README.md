# Sales Effectiveness Prediction and Improvement Project

## Overview

This GitHub repository contains the code and documentation for a project focused on predicting Sales Effectiveness and providing actionable insights to enhance sales processes.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Extraction**: We used MYSQL to extract essential data from the client's database.

- **Feature Engineering**: The data underwent transformations and filtering using Feature Engineering and Filtering functions to optimize the reporting process.

- **Machine Learning Model**: We developed a predictive ML model for Sales Effectiveness.

- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib and Seaborn were employed to visualize the data, identifying key drivers of Sales Effectiveness.

- **Comprehensive Report**: The project culminated in a Comprehensive Project Report that offers data-driven recommendations for improving Sales Processes.

## Estimated Impact

Based on our analysis, implementing the data-driven decisions and recommendations outlined in the report could potentially result in a substantial increase in Sales, estimated to range from 20% to 30%.
